This project predicts survival outcomes from the Titanic dataset using machine learning regression models. The goal was to evaluate different models and improve prediction accuracy by preprocessing the data and selecting the best-performing algorithm.

Features:
Dataset: Titanic dataset with features like age, gender, class, and fare.
Models: Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
Techniques: Feature standardization, cross-validation, and performance metrics (L2 and L1 losses).
Tools Used:
Python
Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib
Key Results:
Gradient Boosting achieved the lowest L2 loss and best accuracy, proving its robustness for non-linear relationships in the dataset.

Instructions:
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter notebook to explore data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
